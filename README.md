## What is AGI?
> Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aims to create highly advanced AI systems that possess human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks and domains. Unlike narrow AI, which specializes in specific tasks, AGI encompasses learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and natural language understanding. While AGI is an ambitious goal, its pursuit has resulted in significant advancements in AI. The development of AGI has the potential to revolutionize industries like healthcare, finance, transportation, and education. However, it also brings forth important considerations related to ethics, safety, and societal impact that need to be carefully addressed.
